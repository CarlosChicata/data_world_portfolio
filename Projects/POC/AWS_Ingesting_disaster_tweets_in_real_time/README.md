## Purpose and warning
The purpose this POC is to get several tweets about real disaster in real time, classify it and store in data warehouse system to analysis from data team; but you need to be cared because  some tweets are joke.

My acceptance criterias are:

* Processing in (near) real time the tweets.
* Store all tweets in data warehouse to consume.
* Create a data model to support the storage.
