# Proof of concept from cloud! 

## Purpose and warning

The goal is show all proof of concept that i implemented based in several cloud providers. The main goal is show my hard skills to using the tools of several cloud providers to achieve a specified given goal by the POC. i want a be a good data engineering


## List of portfolio cases

This is my portfolio projects i built it based in this case.

| NÂ° of Case | Title | Short description | Tools | Level |Cloud Provider | Concepts | Status |
|------------|-------|-------------------|-------|-------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | API of Serving layer from data lake | Create a HTTP API to consume a data model is stored in data lake. | `AWS S3`, `AWS Athena`, `AWS API gateway`, `Python` | AWS | 1 / 5 | `Data lake`, `Data modeling`, `AWS tools`  | `Finished` :rocket: |
| 2 | GraphQL API of Serving layer from data lake | Create a GraphQL API to consume a data model is stored in data lake. | `AWS S3`, `AWS Athena`, `AWS AppSync`, `Python` | AWS |  1 / 5 |  `Data lake`, `Data modeling`, `AWS tools` | `Finished` ðŸ¤© |
| 3 | API of Serving layer from data lake V2 | Optimize some point in case #1 to improve the performance and security |  `AWS IAM`,`AWS Athena`, `AWS API gateway`, `Python` | AWS | 2 / 5 | `Data lake`, `Data modeling`, `AWS tools`  | `Get ready to start` |
| 4 | Formatting for AWS Glue: CSV to Parquet format file | Search to way to format CSV file to parquet file, and can be use for AWS Athena | `AWS Athena`, `Python`, `Dataframe framework`| AWS | 1 / 5  | `File formatting`, `AWS tools`, `Data conversion` | `Get ready to start` |
| 5 | Formatting for AWS Glue: CSV to Iceberg format file | Search to way to format CSV file to Iceberg file, and can be use for AWS Athena | `AWS Athena`, `Python`, `Dataframe framework`| AWS | 2 / 5  | `File formatting`, `AWS tools`, `Data conversion` | `Get ready to start` |
| 6 | GraphQL API of Serving layer from data lake V2 | Optimize some point in case #2 to improve the performance |  `AWS IAM`,`AWS Athena`, `AWS AppSync`, `Python` | AWS | 2 / 5 | `Data lake`, `Data modeling`, `AWS tools`  | `Get ready to start` |
