| NÂ° of Case | Title | Short description | Tools | Level |Cloud Provider | Concepts | Status |
|------------|-------|-------------------|-------|-------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | REST API of Serving layer from data lake | Create a REST API to consume a data model is stored in data lake. | `AWS S3`, `AWS Athena`, `AWS API gateway` | AWS | 1 / 5 | Data lake, Data modeling  | `Finished` :rocket: |
| 2 | GraphQL API of Serving layer from data lake | Create a GraphQL API to consume a data model is stored in data lake. | `AWS S3`, `AWS Athena`, `AWS AppSync` | AWS |  1 / 5 |  Data lake, Data modeling | `Progress` |
| 3 | REST API of Serving layer from data lake V2 | Optimize some point in case #1 to improve the performance and security |  `AWS IAM`,`AWS Athena`, `AWS API gateway` | AWS | 2 / 5 | Data lake, Data modeling  | `Get ready to start` |
