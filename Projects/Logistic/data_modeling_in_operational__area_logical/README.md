# Case 2: Data modeling in operational area: logical focus to operational activities

## Purpose and warning

In case 1; I understood how mandalo will work in process, generate data and how entities need. So then, in this part i need to extend the data modeling; it's in conceptual level; to logical level to give more details to IT and business views.

In this case the artifact will be a logical data modeling; but a thinking i will implement  in operational system and not analytical.

## Why will i do?

There are any difference in operational and analytical data model. The operational data model support update and insert operations in high amount, need to be process so fast so possible then the operations need to be minimum amount, not too complexity processing aggregation queries, not too integrated and few data use. Analytical data model support read in high amount and insert in middle amount but last one dependent in type of consume from user; process complex aggregation queries; too integrated and/or return high amount of data.

So then, i need to implement a operational data model focus logical view; **why logical view?** because the logical data model _translate the conceptual model into structure of specified tables and columns that any DBMS can implement it_ (The main feature that separate it the physical model); that comply the operational focus. In physical data model;  dependently the chosen DB i can implement more details to achieve a performance in operations; but the logical model will give me the amount of operations, complexity of query to support insert and read data operations and indicate how the evolution of corporate data architecture model will be

## Common queries will use

This section is need because i need to know what common queries will be implement to support main process in operation, and understand what this structure.

## Technical decision to create it 

This section in separate in 2 parts: analyze the previous section and decisions derived from it.

### Analyzing common queries

I checked all common queries from previous section, i detected some points:

* In general and regular cases, there are master data entities that are more accessed to read than other ones:
  * Shipment, route, order, branch, incidents, city and country.
  * Vehicle, driver, enterprise, Warehouse.
  * Request, internal request.
  * Others.
* In general and regular cases, there are master data entities that are more update and write than other ones:
  * Shipment, Status event order, order.
  * Route, Status event route.
  * Request and internal request.
  * Vehicle, warehouse, drivers.
  * Others.
* I need to apply soft delete in all register of master data, to keep all context in operations as long as possible.
* In amount of queries generated from mobile into entities: status event order, order(some fields), route (some fields), driver, vehicle(some fields), historial of driver.
* In mobile devices, it need to read more setup data, entities like: city, country, warehouse, incidents, vehicle, historial of driver, shipment (some fields).
* Some fields of shipment entity need to be in others entities to improve the reading opts by improve the operation read: order, city and country.
* I need to get flexibility to extend the follow entities by others areas will come (finance or operational): shipment, route, order, request, driver, warehouse.
* I need support geospatial queries: point inside of polygon.
* There are a group of entities classified like resource that are management in some points of operation: warehouse, vehicle and drivers.

### DecisiÃ³n of design

These are decision making based on previous subsection.

* I need to separate the geospatial queries of tradicional queries in difference tables.
* Based in high write operations; these following table don't need to get extra info in its own table: Shipment and Status event order.

### Note in diagram

_*_ The field in the table have a relationship with other table that define a schema of data. Generally it's applied in array of custom data type like field.

_**_ The Driver, vehicle and warehouse table are classified like resource, so then any one of them (only one of them) can be referenced to resource. It can be selected in operational act.

_***_ This field can be implemented freely and it not require a fixed schema.
